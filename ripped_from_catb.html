        <p>The graphic at the top of the page is called a <em>glider</em>. It's
        a pattern from a mathematical simulation called the <a href=
        'http://dmoz.org/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life/'>
        Game of Life</a>. In this simulation, very simple rules about the
        behavior of dots on a grid give rise to wonderfully complex emergent
        phenomena. The glider is the simplest Life pattern that moves, and the
        most instantly recognizable of all Life patterns.</p>


        <h1 id='why'>Why have an emblem at all?</h1>


        <p>To some hackers, having an emblem might smack too much of
        groupthink. But the hacker community is, in fact, a community, knit
        together by trust bonds over the Internet. One thing we've learned
        since 1991 is that visible emblems of community are just as valuable to
        hackers as they are to other kind of human beings. They help us
        recognize each other, help us affirm common values and cooperate more
        closely. They're useful social engineering.</p>


        <p>Using this emblem means something a little different from just
        presenting yourself as a Linux fan, or a Perl-monger, or a member of
        any of the hacker subtribes that have become so successful since the
        mid-1990s. These are relatively recent developments in a tradition that
        goes back decades. Back to the homewbrew microcomputer experimenters of
        the early 1970s; the earliest Unix developers and ARPANET engineers in
        1969; and to the SPACEWAR hackers at MIT in 1961.</p>


        <p>The hackers, in the broadest sense, are the people who built the
        Internet, and Unix, and the World Wide Web; our dreams of freedom have
        changed the world everybody lives in. See <a href=
        '/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html'>How To Become A Hacker</a> for an
        in-depth look at what that means. If you find yourself nodding in
        agreement as you read that document, you are one of the people who
        should be using this emblem.</p>


        <h1>Why this emblem?</h1>


        <p>The glider is an appropriate emblem on many levels. Start with
        history: the Game of Life was first publicly described in
        <cite>Scientific American</cite> in 1970. It was born at almost the
        same time as the Internet and Unix. It has fascinated hackers ever
        since.</p>


        <p>In the Game of Life, simple rules of cooperation with what's nearby
        lead to unexpected, even startling complexities that you could not have
        predicted from the rules (emergent phenomena). This is a neat parallel
        to the way that startling and unexpected phenomena like open-source
        development emerge in the hacker community.</p>


        <p>The glider fulfils the criteria for a good logo. It's simple, bold,
        hard to mistake for anything else, and easy to print on a mug or
        T-shirt. It could be varied, combined with other emblems, or modified
        and infinitely repeated for use as a background.</p>


        <h1>But what if the wrong people start using it?</h1>


        <p>A lot of people think this emblem will become worse than useless
        because script kiddies, crackers and wannabes will be the predominant
        ones to use it. Yes, that is a risk &mdash; but other emblems, like the
        peace sign or the A-for-anarchy, that have similar risks have retained
        a lot of utility. If it helps, I've gotten a lot of email from people
        picking up on it that I know to be hard-core hackers, and I've seen
        almost no abuse of it.</p>


        <h1>Will you carry my slightly different idea for an emblem?</h1>


        <p>Probably not. Part of the point of an emblem like this is instant
        recognizability. That goal is compromised if there is a lot of
        variation among the instances. The two most common suggestions are to
        remove the grid or change the orientation of the glider. Perhaps these
        variants might have been better, or there is some other idea that would
        have been superior, but the benefit of having <em>one</em> emblem means
        it would be a bad idea to switch now that this one has a following. I
        will carry only images in which the plain-vanilla graphic at the top of
        this page is clearly recognizable.</p>
