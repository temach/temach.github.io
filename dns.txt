So after you have bought a rinserepeat.site domain on reg.ru
You want to host your own DNS server. Cause you want to do it for free :)
zonomi.com is great for starting out, but to continue you need to own the
infrastructure.

So you roll a docker container with bind in it onto your shiny VPS.
Then you login to Webmin :) And check out the options.
First step it to edit the zone config SOA record.
Make sure that its "autorative name server" aka "root server" points
to ns1.rinserepeat.site
Then make sure to add an IP Address (A) record such that ns1.rinserepeat.site points to the ip address on which you run bind.
Now here can you see the problem? You have a random machine on the internet that runs bind with a SOA record that says: to get any info about rinserepeat.site ask ns1.rinserepeat.site. Well you dont know the IP of ns1.rinserepeat.site do you??
For this reson glue records exist. See https://forums.he.net/index.php?topic=629.0
Then you investigate the interface of reg.ru and find the bottom of this page: https://www.reg.ru/support/dns/DNS-servery/kak-propisat-DNS-dlya-domena-v-lichnom-kabinete
Then you edit your DNS records for your domain and right there you also add the glue record by specifying the IP address of ns1.rinserepeat.site server.

Now you can edit the zones file and stuff should work!
