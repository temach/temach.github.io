The proper way to write english/russian latex in linux?
1) Online :(
2) Install latex distibution
3) With a docker image of course!

If you dont want ot fight dependencies endlessly,
go with docker: https://github.com/senior-sigan/docker-latex
The repository has instructions. What worked best was to add docker-latex/bin directory to
PATH and thus always run the pdflatex from docker container.
The best part is that it has PSCyr and latex-cyrillic already installed.

The only downside is that pdflatex must be run from top-most folder. Because
the folder gets mounted inside docker so only files that are lower in the hierarchy
can be found.
