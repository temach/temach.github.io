Creating VM images: https://people.linaro.org/~riku.voipio/debian-images/

Or look into VMDK (GNS3 uses that) or AMI with Packer
https://packer.io/intro/getting-started/vagrant.html
https://github.com/libyal/libvmdk/blob/master/documentation/VMWare%20Virtual%20Disk%20Format%20(VMDK).asciidoc


Also look into "unattended install" and preseed

Another idea is skipping the install step (using someone-else's OS Template) and just customising on top.

GNS3 template for Ubuntu Server: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GNS3/gns3-registry/master/appliances/ubuntu-server.gns3a

Similar to debootstrap but relying on modifying the contents of the ubuntu's ISO image:

The ISO image when booted will install without human attendance.
