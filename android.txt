About setting up git annex and where is the media stored.

So everything is under /storage/emulated/0

The main folder is the DCIM folder for "Digital Camera IMages" which is standard across android devices. This should be synced.

There is an Edited folder with results from the standard EditPhoto program on sony xperia XZ. Should also be synced.

There is Android/data/com.github.axet.audiorecorder/files/recordings/ with audio story. This should be synced.

There is a Pictures folder, under which there is a Screenshots folder and PhotoshopExpress folder. They should be synced.

There is an XperiaTransfer folder with old photos that should be incorporated.

There is a CallRecorder folder with all the voice calls, that should also be synced.
There is a ScreenRecorder folder this is app specific. For screen recordings.
There is WatsApp/Media with WhatsAppImages and WhatsAppVideo that should be synced.
