.Xresources  
File where programs can typically look for their settings. 
For example rxvt and its clones look there and so do vim and emacs. Some progs look in .Xdefaults. A small number of progs look for files in "app-defaults" dir (that is `/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults`)
To use it properly you should know about `xrdb`, `xrdb -merge` and `listres`.
To find the name of program's instance and its class:
1) open the program
2) in terminal start `xprop`
3) click on the running program and look for line `WM_CLASS(STRING) = "prog_instance", "prog_class"`
For example running `xprop` on "xterm" gives `WM_CLASS(STRING) = "xterm", "XTerm"`
NOTE: when you write entry for .Xresources or .Xdefaults use EITHER prog_instance OR prog_class as first value

To set up fonts know about `fc-list` and it option `fc-list -v` to show everything.
Especially interesting line is `fullname: "Some font"` which tells you how the font is called on this computer.
`xfontsel` shows you all the X11 fonts and allows to set system wide font. (it goes into .Xresources)
