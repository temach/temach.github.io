.Xresources  
File where programs can typically look for their settings. 
For example rxvt and its clones look there and so do vim and emacs. Some progs look in .Xdefaults. A small number of progs look for files in "app-defaults" dir (that is `/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults`)
To use it properly you should know about `xrdb`, `xrdb -merge` and `listres`. (xrdb is to source the config)
To find the name of program's instance and its class:
1) open the program
2) in terminal start `xprop`
3) click on the running program and look for line `WM_CLASS(STRING) = "prog_instance", "prog_class"`
For example running `xprop` on "xterm" gives `WM_CLASS(STRING) = "xterm", "XTerm"`
NOTE: when you write entry for .Xresources or .Xdefaults use EITHER prog_instance OR prog_class as first value
Avoid blank spaces at the beginning and end of lines in the .Xresources file

To set up fonts know about `fc-list` and it option `fc-list -v` to show everything.
Especially interesting line is `fullname: "Some font"` which tells you how the font is called on this computer.
`xfontsel` shows you all the X11 fonts and allows to set system wide font. (it goes into .Xresources)

To monitor unintended system changes: Tripwire (tells you when checksums for packages change)
also: rkhunter and chkrootkit

check integrity of installed packages: debsums

You can use `dmesg --follow` to find name of a device (like: `/dev/ttyUSB0`) as you plug it in.


After you compile (make && sudo make install) remember to run ldconfig
This can (and will) absolutely save you!!

Postgres leaves around many, many pg_xxxxx files (in particular pg_config which can unintentionally prevent you from reinstalling postgres correctly) so when you delete postgres, delete them too!
