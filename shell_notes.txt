xev     # Inspect keyboard input/modifiers and mouse events

.Xresources  
File where programs can typically look for their settings. 
For example rxvt and its clones look there and so do vim and emacs. 
To use it properly you should know about `xrdb`, `xrdb -merge` and `listres`.
To know the name of program's instance and its class:
1) open the program
2) in terminal start `xprop`
3) click on the running program and look for line `WM_CLASS(STRING) = "prog_instance", "prog_class"`
For example running `xprop` on "xterm" gives `WM_CLASS(STRING) = "xterm", "XTerm"`

To set up fonts know about `fc-list` and it option `fc-list -v` to show everything.
Especially interesting line is `fullname: "Some font"` which tells you how the font is called on this computer.
`xfontsel` shows you all the X11 fonts and allows to set system wide font. (it goes into .Xresources)
