xev     # Inspect keyboard input/modifiers and mouse events

in all your scripts: add "set -u" option. This will make sure that all your variables 
are (initialised/not empty) before use. (Otherwise `rm -rf "$foo/$bar"` will 
ERASE your filesystem when $foo and $bar are empty/uninitialised) 

Also for safer bash scripting see: https://sipb.mit.edu/doc/safe-shell/

shopt options (note: shopt and set are very similar but different commands):
http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html


map caps to escape:
setxkbmap -option "caps:escape"
also: `xkbprint :0.0` to print map for zero display to postscript/ghostscript file and 
then use `ps2pdf filename.ps` to make a pdf image.

Know about ibus, used for interactive text entry in multilingual environment.

"sudo apt-get install build-essentials" on new ubuntu machine.

On unubtu to restart JUST the window manager (the unity window manager):
`DISPLAY=:0 unity --replace` or `compiz --replace` commands (since unity is a compiz plugin)
this is just the gui restart so your applications will be unaffected.
Also you can ALT+F2, type `unity`, hit ENTER, this should restart unity as well.
Actually many window managers take the --replace option, which can 
function as a window manager restart. So remember about it the next time
your gui freezes!

To restart the X server (display manager a.k.a. "dm") use 
You should type: sudo service XXX restart
The XXX should be (without quotes):
    gdm if you use Ubuntu 11.04 or older
    lightdm for Ubuntu 11.10




.Xresources  
File where programs can typically look for their settings. 
For example rxvt and its clones look there and so do vim and emacs. Some progs look in .Xdefaults. A small number of progs look for files in "app-defaults" dir (that is `/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults`)
To use it properly you should know about `xrdb`, `xrdb -merge` and `listres`. (xrdb is to source the config)
To find the name of program's instance and its class:
1) open the program
2) in terminal start `xprop`
3) click on the running program and look for line `WM_CLASS(STRING) = "prog_instance", "prog_class"`
For example running `xprop` on "xterm" gives `WM_CLASS(STRING) = "xterm", "XTerm"`
NOTE: when you write entry for .Xresources or .Xdefaults use EITHER prog_instance OR prog_class as first value
Avoid blank spaces at the beginning and end of lines in the .Xresources file

How to use X resources:

To set up fonts know about `fc-list` and it option `fc-list -v` to show everything.
Especially interesting line is `fullname: "Some font"` which tells you how the font is called on this computer.
`xfontsel` shows you all the X11 fonts and allows to set system wide font. (it goes into .Xresources)


for xargs:

Use the comma ',' as the separator and sort by the 2nd field.
`sort -t',' -k2`


To monitor unintended system changes: Tripwire (tells you when checksums for packages change)
also: rkhunter and chkrootkit

check integrity of installed packages: debsums

You can use `dmesg --follow` to find name of a device (like: `/dev/ttyUSB0`) as you plug it in.


After you compile (make && sudo make install) remember to run ldconfig
This can (and will) absolutely save you!!

Postgres leaves around many, many pg_xxxxx files (in particular pg_config which can unintentionally prevent you from reinstalling postgres correctly) so when you delete postgres, delete them too!
