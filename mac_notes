Customise spotlight search (add shortcuts for example):
1) execute: defaults read
2) search under "com.apple.spotlight" for "UserShortcuts"
3) read defaults manpage and change "UserShortcuts" as you want.

Actually spotlight caches your most common input and associates it with a path to a file/program.

Also know about ioreg command.
