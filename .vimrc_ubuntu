" =========== Vim tips ===================
" Complete previous = <C-P>
" Complete next = <C-N>
"
" Goto old cursor location = <C-O>
" Goto next cursor location = <C-I>
" Use <C-O><C-O> to reopen closed file where you have been
"
" Press % when the cursor is on a quote, paren, bracket, or brace to find its
" match, if the cursor is not over any of those it shifts to the right until
" it hits one of them.
"
" q<letter> - records a macro.
" and
" @<same-letter> - plays it back.
"
" To sort items in a file.
" :%!sort
" To sort items in line range 3-5
" :3,5!sort
"
" To comment select some line using CTRL+V then insert some char at the beginning of each
" column useing 'I' (to insert before the selection) and then '#'.
" also you can use 'A' (to append to selection)
"
" Use vim-bindings on the command line in bash: 'set -o vi' In other,
" readline-using programs, hit control-alt-j to switch from emacs to vim bindings.
"
" Search first and then vim will re-use your search. For example:
" /blue\(\d\+\)
" :%s//red\1/
" Is equivalent to:
" :%s/blue\(\d\+\)/red\1/
"
" Short and useful:
" sort selected rows                       :sort
" search for word under cursor             *
" format selected code                     =
" convert selected text to uppercase       U
" convert selected text to lowercase       u
" invert case of selected text             ~
" convert tabs to spaces                   :retab
" start recording a macro                  qX (X = key to assign macro to)
" stop recording a macro                   q
" playback macro                           @X (X = key macro was assigned to)
" replay previously played macro *         @@
" auto-complete a word you are typing **   CTRL + n
" bookmark current place in file           mX (X = key to assign bookmark to)
" jump to bookmark                         `X (X = key bookmark was assigned
"                                               ` = back tick/tilde key)
" show all bookmarks                       :marks
" close all other split screens            :only
"
" In normal mode you can use * and # to search for a word under the cursor.
" * searches forward for the word, while # searches backwards.



" ================ General ==================
" Vim, not vi. To use advanced features, put this at the start of .vimrc
set nocompatible

" When opening new file vim will look for special commands in it and run them
" We disable this ablity
set nomodeline

" Sets how many lines of history VIM has to remember (default is 20)
set history=300

" Number of undo levels
set undolevels=400

" Disable showmarks plugin
let showmarks_enable=0

" Start pathogen plugin
execute pathogen#infect()



" =========== FILES =================
" Help when typing commands (after colon in last line mode)
set wildmenu

" Ignore temporary object files when menu completion
" set wildignore=*.o,*~,*.pyc,*/.DS_Store,*/.git/*,*/.svn/*,*/.hg/*

" Lookup ctags -tags- file up in the directory until one is found
set tags=tags;/

" New awesome stuff: Persistent Undo!
set undofile                " Save undo's after file closes
set undodir=~/.vim/undo/    " where to save undo histories
set undolevels=1000         " How many undos
set undoreload=10000        " number of lines to save for undo

" Enable filetype plugins
filetype plugin on
filetype indent on

" set UTF-8 as standard encoding and en_US as standard language
set encoding=utf8

" Use unix as the standard file type (for line endings and so on)
" Will be tried in order (unix first)
set ffs=unix,mac,dos


" Return to last edit position when opening files (You want this!)
" autocmd BufReadPost *
"     \ if line("'\"") > 0 && line("'\"") <= line("$") |
"     \   exe "normal! g`\"" |
"     \ endif

" The idea of 'viminfo' is to save info from one editing session for the next
" by saving the data in an 'viminfo file'. So next time I start up Vim I can
" use the search patterns from the search history and the commands from the
" command line again. I can also load files again with a simple ':b bufname'.
" And Vim also remember where the cursor was in the files I edited. See ':help
" viminfo' for more info on Vim's 'viminfo'. :-}
set viminfo=%,'50,\"100,:100,n~/.viminfo



" =============== MOVEMENT =========================
set scrolloff=5               " keep at least 5 lines above/below cursor
set sidescrolloff=5           " keep at least 5 lines left/right cursor

" Configure backspace so it acts as it should act
set backspace=eol,start,indent

" There are several commands which move the cursor within the line. When you
" get to the start/end of a line then these commands will fail as you cannot
" go on. However, many users expect the cursor to be moved onto the
" previous/next line. Vim allows you to chose which commands will -wrap- the
" cursor around the line borders. Here I allow the cursor left/right keys and
" dis-allow using 'h','l' keys. Then h,l can only move within the line.
set whichwrap=<,>

" Moving lines and blocks up and down in normal/insert/visual modes
" note: this maps to ALT + motion key
" see http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Moving_lines_up_or_down

" ========================= COLORS AND FONTS ======================
" tell vim to expect 256 colors (some terminals may not support so many colors?)
set t_Co=256

" Set t_ut to disable Background Color Erase.
" Now vim should not try to use default terminal color for background
" See http://sunaku.github.io/vim-256color-bce.html

" show location of cursor using a horizontal line.

" consider adding '+= k' to scan in dictionary
set complete=.,w,b,u,U,t,i,d



" ===================== ALIASES AND SHORTCUTS =======================
" Enter :sss to toggle and untoggle spell checking
" SetupCommandAlias('sss', 'setlocal spell!')

" Swap ; and :  Convenient. Semi-colon is a rare command. Colon is always!
nnoremap ; :
nnoremap : ;

" This is totally awesome - remap jj to escape in insert mode.
" You'll never type jj anyway, so it's great!
inoremap jk <Esc>
inoremap kj <Esc>

" Not sure why this line is here, it relates to the previous one (mapping jj to <Esc>)
nnoremap JJJJ <Nop>

"This unsets the -last search pattern- register by hitting return

"Remove all trailing whitespace by pressing F5
nnoremap <F5> :let _s=@/<Bar>:%s/\s\+$//e<Bar>:let @/=_s<Bar>:nohl<CR>

" normal mode.
