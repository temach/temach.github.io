                        <p>Below is a large list of some useful commands for Git Version Control.
                        You may not use them all in the same day, but you will most likely use them
                        at least once and very often more than that. Git makes your life simple.
                        Learn the commands.</p>

                            designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
                            speed and efficiency.” – Git Website</p>

                            <p>In all of the following, a merge strategy can be specified by the
                            “-s strategy” argument, which can be one of: “resolve”, “recursive”,
                            “octopus”, “ours”, or “subtree”. If you tried a merge which resulted in
                            a complex conflicts and would want to start over, you can recover with
                            “git reset –hard”. If you accidently merged and want to unmerge, you
                            can “git reset –hard ORIG_HEAD”.</p>

                            <h3>Undoing</h3>

                            <p>Reverting is different from resetting in that reverts usually create
                            new history while resets usually remove existing history. The changes
                            of a revert are applied to the current state of the repository, and, if
                            committed, results in a new repository state descending from the
                            current one. Reverts are safe to publish even if they revert a
                            previously published commit, and, in fact, are the correct way of
                            dealing with the undoing of published commits. Resetting, on the other
                            hand, represents (a possibly selective) “rewind” to a previous state in
                            the history “starting again” from there. Resets should never be
                            committed if they undo commits that have been published or pushed to
                            remote repositories, as this would result in invalid object histories
                            and commit ID’s in the remote repositories.</p>
