Points:
1. A breakpoint stops your program whenever a particular point in the program is reached.
2. A watchpoint stops your program whenever the value of a variable or expression changes.
3. A catchpoint stops your program whenever a particular event occurs.

ignore, enable, disable, clear, delete          for breakpoints
ignore = conditional breakpoint
delete                        with no args kills _all_ breakpoints
clear funcname                remove all bp from inside function called funcname
info breakpoints              see all breakpoints

break +3                      set break point 3 lines above currnt line
break filename:linenumber     set break point in some file at some line. Note the : as delimeter.
break                         with no arg set bp on current line
break .... if i==2            conditional bp, the ... is bp location and i==2 is the condition



run arg1 arg2 arg3            will give arg1 arg2 and arg3 to your program as inputs

ptype varname                 print type of variable, function, struct, array, union. Includes field names!!!
print varname                 print value of variable

typecast the variable as you print it:
print (char) mydouble

$34 refers to the result number 34, and plain $ refers to last result:
print $52

Access array item's type and value:
ptype myIntArray[3]
print myIntArray[3]




Abbreviations
bp = breakpoint

br = break cmd
pt = ptype cmd
