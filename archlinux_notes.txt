To completely remove packages:
pacman -Rns mypackagename

Good commands:
pacman

# see how many you can update
checkupdates    

# read PKGBUILD file, download code and make a so-called pkg (actually a .pkg.tar.gz with a special file)
# Now you can use pacman to install this so-called pkg.
makepkg

# control services on the system
systemctl
