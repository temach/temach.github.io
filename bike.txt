So you need a bike thats ready for adventure?

A couple of things!

If you are ever planning to cross water with your bike,
I advise getting 3 or even 4 hermetic bags (гермомешок).
Strap one to each wheel, one under the pedal and one under the bike handle.
Just remember that if and when water gets into the bike tubes, the
tubes will need to be repaired soon. So water is really not for bikes :(

Another interesting idea was to wrap the whole bike in a plastic tube.

Anyway, on to the bike wheels and tyres!
So for the bike to go it has a wheel. On top of the wheel sits an air tube (some modern super-cool bikes allow you to ride tubeless). On top of the air tube sits the tyre.

Here lets talk about tyres. The best brand is Schwalbe :)
Tyres have a couple of metrics:
How well they roll.
Their grip with flat road.
Their grip off-road.
Their durability/protection against puncture.

If you want the tyre to roll well then it must be flat and hard (like a plastic tube).
Best rolling is when hard tyre rolls on hard road with minimal contact surface.
Best on road grip is when the tyre has flat protector and soft rubber.
Best off-road grip is when the tyre has deep protector (engravings) made of
hard rubber, off-road tyres also have deep protector on the sides of the tyre,
to help when turning.

When you are looking at Schwalbe website things to remember:
MTB = mountain bike, off-road action tyres.
E-bike = electric bike, tyres for going extra fast with extra weight of the electric motor.
Road vs Tour = road is inside the city and racing, tour is adventure.
Balloon tyres = Big tyres that should be driven half flat inside the city only. They are
supposed to make driving over train tracks and gravel less bumpy.
Tubeless ready/Tubeless easy = this tyre can be used tubeless.

A tyre is made up of three parts, see https://www.schwalbe.com/en/reifenaufbau.html:
1) bead core
2) carcass
3) rubber compound = protector = tire thread

Tyres from Schwalbe also have:
2.5) Protection belt (rubber layer)

The bead core can be made flaxible or inflexible. If its flexible the tyre is labeled
as "Folding" and costs more, because of bendable kevlar beads instead of harder aluminium.

Schwalbe has a catalogue of all its tyres with descriptions:
