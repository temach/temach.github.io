So you need a bike thats ready for adventure?

A couple of things!

If you are ever planning to cross water with your bike,
I advise getting 3 or even 4 hermetic bags (гермомешок).
Strap one to each wheel, one under the pedal and one under the bike handle.
Just remember that if and when water gets into the bike tubes, the
tubes will need to be repaired soon. So water is really not for bikes :(

Another interesting idea was to wrap the whole bike in a plastic tube.

Anyway, on to the bike wheels and tyres!
So for the bike to go it has a wheel. On top of the wheel sits an air tube (some modern super-cool bikes allow you to ride tubeless). On top of the air tube sits the tyre.

Here lets talk about tyres. The best brand is Schwalbe :)
Tyres have a couple of metrics:
How well they roll.
Their grip with flat road.
Their grip off-road.
Their durability/protection against puncture.

If you want the tyre to roll well then it must be flat and hard (like a plastic tube).
Best rolling is when hard tyre rolls on hard road with minimal contact surface.
Best on road grip is when the tyre has flat protector and soft rubber.
Best off-road grip is when the tyre has deep protector (engravings) made of
hard rubber, off-road tyres also have deep protector on the sides of the tyre,
to help when turning.

When you are looking at Schwalbe website things to remember:
MTB = mountain bike, off-road action tyres.
E-bike = electric bike, tyres for going extra fast with extra weight of the electric motor.
Road vs Tour = road is inside the city and racing, tour is adventure.
Balloon tyres = Big tyres that should be driven half flat inside the city only. They are
supposed to make driving over train tracks and gravel less bumpy.
Tubeless ready/Tubeless easy = this tyre can be used tubeless.

A tyre is made up of three parts, see https://www.schwalbe.com/en/reifenaufbau.html:
1) bead core
2) carcass
3) rubber compound = protector = tire thread

Tyres from Schwalbe also have:
2.5) Protection belt (rubber layer)

The bead core can be made flaxible or inflexible. If its flexible the tyre is labeled
as "Folding" and costs more, because of bendable kevlar beads instead of harder aluminium.

Schwalbe has a catalogue of all its tyres with descriptions:

See here for the tyre sizes: https://www.schwalbe.com/en/groessenbezeichnung.html

Some blog posts with overview and partial info about tyres:

After studying the catalog I settled on the following filters:
Tour tyres AND Protection >=6 AND Off-Road Grip >=3

After this my choice was "Велопокрышка Schwalbe Marathon GT Tour"

Talking about wheels, one thing to consider is their diameter.
Well apparently the most common mountain bike diameters are 26 inches, 27.5 inches and 29 inches.
Furthermore the difference between them appears to be marketing FUD and superficial.
See http://велосипед.bikeway.ru/какой-велосипед-выбрать-29-27-5-или-26-дюймов/

Also on the black bike the tyre is 26" x 1.75"

The next part to choose is the back rack//carrige/багажник.
The first thing to consider is whether your bike has modern disk brakes or classic V-type brakes on the wheel.
In case of disk brakes only special racks can be mounted. They need to have a bend in their leg to go
around the braking mechanism. This bend can be done in one of two ways:
1) the rack leg is curved
2) the rack leg is straight but its further away from the bike and a bolt at 90-degrees is used to attach it.

I think the first way is better, especially if you are not loading the full 25-30kg. Because a 90-degree angle
will break on a hard bump and just looks super insecure on affordable racks.

If there is an option steel racks are more sturdy than aluminium and they cost less. Becasue they
degrade faster and are heavier, but that does not seem like a big problem to me to be honest.

Finally choose a rack that fits your wheel size or is adjustable. And make sure your bike has holes
so the thin bars at the top of the rack can attach to the triangular bars just below the bike seat.

Choosing a rack is not simple when you want to find the balance between price and quality.
Basically quality racks are way too expensive. And cheap racks are just shit and you risk them braking on you.
