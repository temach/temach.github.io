Info on ansible:

So you have a control machine and slave nodes.

To test your install add some servers that have a running ssh to your
/ets/ansible/hosts file (create it if not present). You can add 127.0.0.1 to start with.

Then ping them to check all is ok. If you just bought a VPS then it has only root user and
you have not established ssh keys yet. So tell ansible to login as root and to ask you for
password.

$ ansible all -m ping -vvv --ask-pass --user=root
